#### Matthew Mueller 
# Computer Science Final Project
## This is a group of small interactive games
## Project Proposal:
### - What will your code do?
#### My project will be a user input videogame. It will follow a storyline, with items/pets you can pick up along the way which will help you later. Scores (will have to figure out what the score will be based on) will be kept in a dictionary with player names. I will make sure to include the necessary topics reviewed over the school year to get points.
### - What requirements will your code have?
#### It will use the input function for players to interact with the game. I might make a main game which you can play, and then some mini spin-offs located in other files which can be called in.
### - What would a stretch goal be for this project? - Come up with something extra that you can work on once you finish your main goals for the project.
#### A stretch goal would be to find a way to get VS Code to pop up another interface with clickable buttons to interact with the game, instead of using user input in the terminal.
